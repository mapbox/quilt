# Quilt

`@mapbox/quilt` is a light-weight utility library for patching together responses from the Mapbox [Static Tiles API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#static-tiles) based on a given coordinate pair. It primarily takes its inspiration from [`@mapbox/abaculus`](https://github.com/mapbox/abaculus).

It is put to best use when you need to generate quick debugging images of how several different Mapbox styles will look when rendered by the Mapbox Static Tiles API.

## Usage

This library is written using a "constructor" framework. In order to retrieve an image, you must first initialize your "getImage" function with the desired configuration for your final image (coordinates, zoom level, & desired image size). You can then use your constructed function to return an image generated by stitching tiles together for one or more Mapbox styles at that location.

**usage example**
```js
const { makeGetQuilt } = require('@mapbox/quilt');

const getTileQuilt = makeGetQuilt(coordinates, zoom, size);
const finalImage = getTileQuilt({ style, accessToken })
  .then((err, result) => {
    return result;
    // expected result:
    // {
    //   decoded: < decoded PNG >,
    //   original: < Buffer > 
    // }
  })
```

## Developing

The package is tested on node v10 & v12, and cannot be assumed to work as expected when using alternate versions.

Tests are written with Jest & require that you have a valid Mapbox Access Token available via an environment variable (both `MapboxAccessToken` or `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` will be considered valid variable names). 

In order to ensure you are using the proper token, we recommend running the tests like so:

**zsh:**
```bash
MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your.token npm test
```

**bash:**
```bash
export MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your.token && npm test
```
